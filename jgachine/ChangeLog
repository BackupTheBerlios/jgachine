	* added simple pong game

	* started tutorial

	* tested Server with sun's jre 1.4.2 - and it works!

	* cleaned up Makefiles a bit

	* cleaned up the resource stuff a bit

	* input now uses signal/slot
	=> may lead to runtime errors but very flexible
	(methods can't be fetched at compile time)
	=> we can add new input events without changing the API
	and breaking compatibility - well old jgachines will
	not report new events and old games will not handle
	new events - depending on the events this could be no
	problem

2003-11-09  Jens Thiele  <karme@berlios.de>

	* simple signal/slot implementation

	* client may now be used standalone (without server)

2003-11-03  Jens Thiele  <karme@berlios.de>
