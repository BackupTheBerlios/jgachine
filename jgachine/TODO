 - security: client and server are completely insecure !!
	client: improve MySecurityManager
	server: either add a SecurityManager or at least fix the
		file/resource upload 
		(perhaps simply use http for this - problem: then you
		must keep your server code in sync with the code you
		serv via http... not a real problem is it?
		many people do not have a http server - perhaps ship
		with a minimalistic one => the same security problems
		again;-)
- input: 
	buttons
	user definable keys

- networking: 
	flush!!
	distributed scene graph (is it possible to do a general one
	working good enough for interactive realtime games?)

	synchronous vs. asynchronous vs. both handling:
		completely asynchronous:
			simple to implement but difficult to use
		completely synchronous:
			simple to implement but introduces
			unneccessary lag
		both:
			handle manually: difficult to use
			automatic: difficult to implement

	server: make base code optinal part of jgachine?
		threading issues
	NetResourceLoader:
		todo: in the moment only one outstanding resource
		request permitted

- sound: completely missing

- video:
	* better font / or better text handling in general
	* performance: in the moment we assume hardware accelerated OpenGL 
	  is available (premature optimization is ...)
	* sdlopengl: in the moment we have GL_BLEND always on
	  (this causes a big slowdown at least with my gf2 mx -
	   switch it on/off as needed)
	* motion blur:
		okay i did a fullscreen motion blur with glCopyTexSubImage2D
		that does not need any user interaction
		what is bad with it?
		the last frame drawn is blended with old frames
		=> everything is smooth => not what I want
		I want the last "frame" sharp ... bad explanation...
		I want to only blur moving objects but the current position is
		not blended/blured. => it must be differentiated between the changing
		screen area and unchanging or better between moving objects and background
		the latter would require the user to specify this
		it could be done using the depth buffer which i did not use so far at all
		another possibility would be to do it with the scenegraph manually
		for now i disable motion blur
		btw could have done the same effect in a much simpler way:
			don't clear the framebuffer
			(perhaps copy front to back buffer)
			draw scene alpha blended
		the tutorial (pong) does motion blur manually now

- scenegraph:
	perhaps it is a bad idea to use subclasses, better use interfaces?
	add some useful stuff like menus / animations / ...

- build:
	the makefiles suck (you often have to make twice and make clean)
	perhaps use autoconf again
	create portable binaries (just read about lsb tools....):
		this time i will not build static/semi-static ones
		=> i could remove my dlopen opengl stuff from the video part
		(but i used this to get mesa offscreen working on framebuffer...)
		ship with libraries and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (perhaps optional...)

	cross-compile to windows with mingw:
		this is non-trivial at the moment:
			http://www.thisiscool.com/gcc_mingw.htm (search for cross)
			http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java-patches/2003-q2/msg00111.html

- signal:
	at the moment only one object may be passed to a slot (signal consists of
	one object)
	but the server could use arrays (methods with multiple parameters 
	=> slots with multiple objects)

- tutorial:
	started with a pong

- scheduling:
	still sucks
	linux kernel 10ms (2.4)
	perhaps test 2.6 ;-)
	java increases the problem with its garbage collector
	nvidia's drivers do a busy loop while waiting for retrace
		(at least up to version 1.0-4191)
	with motion blur one can sleep for a long time
	=> will not get interrupted that often and it looks great anyway
	(but perhaps this is a matter of taste)

was ich probieren wollte:
der classloader auf client seite laedt die class objekte einfach
ueber den objectstream
