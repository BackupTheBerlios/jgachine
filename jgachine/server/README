Example server (pure java)
you don't have to use this - but it is a good starting point
and shows you the basic protocol:
in the moment any server must be able to read ResourceRequest 
objects from the stream (ObjectInputStream) and write Resource
objects to the stream....
hmmm
perhaps i shouldn't enforce such a "high level" protocol
to allow servers not be written in java....
perhaps the client bootstrap should use the web and then
open a socket connection to the server which may be
freely used by the downloaded code ....

strange thought since the whole point in using java once
was the network part ;-)
for now i will keep it like this
